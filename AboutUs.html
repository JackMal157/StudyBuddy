        <p>Study Buddy is all about helping students connect—with each other and with tutors from around the world. Whether it’s finding a study partner for a tough class or getting help from an experienced tutor, we make it easy. Our website is built on Microsoft Azure to keep things running smoothly and securely, and we use Microsoft Teams to make communication simple—whether you're hopping into a group study session or setting up a one-on-one chat. We’re here to make studying feel a little less overwhelming and a lot more connected.</p>
